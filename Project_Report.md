## 1. Abstract  
Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, and personal data. These attacks are often carried out through deceptive emails that appear legitimate.  

This project presents an **Email Safety Checker**, which uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect phishing emails. The system analyzes email content and metadata such as links and urgency indicators to classify emails as safe or malicious.  

---

## 2. Introduction  
Email communication is widely used in both personal and professional environments. However, it is also one of the most common mediums for cyberattacks, especially phishing.  

Phishing emails are designed to:
- Appear trustworthy  
- Create urgency  
- Redirect users to fake websites  

This project develops a system that automatically analyzes emails and determines whether they are safe or suspicious, helping users avoid potential threats.  

---

## 3. Objectives  
- Detect phishing emails using Machine Learning  
- Analyze email content using NLP techniques  
- Identify suspicious keywords and patterns  
- Provide a clear and understandable output  
- Improve user awareness of cybersecurity risks  

---

## 4. Literature Review  
Traditional rule-based systems detect phishing emails using predefined patterns, but they fail when new attack patterns emerge. Machine Learning models improve detection by learning from data and identifying hidden patterns.  

Deep learning models offer higher accuracy but require large datasets and computational resources. A hybrid approach combining Machine Learning and rule-based logic provides a balanced solution, which is used in this project.  

---

## 5. Problem Statement  
Phishing emails are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making them difficult for users to identify manually. This leads to serious issues such as data theft, financial loss, and security breaches.  

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically detect phishing emails and alert users effectively.  

---

## 6. Methodology  
The system follows a structured approach:  

- Email text is cleaned and normalized  
- TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical features  
- A Naive Bayes classifier predicts phishing probability  
- Metadata such as links and urgency is analyzed  
- Final decision is made using combined logic  

---

## 7. Algorithm  
**Input:** Email Text  
**Output:** Safe or Scam  

**Steps:**  
1. Take email input  
2. Convert text to lowercase  
3. Remove special characters  
4. Replace links with placeholder  
5. Apply TF-IDF transformation  
6. Predict probability using Naive Bayes  
7. Detect suspicious keywords  
8. Analyze metadata (links, urgency, capitalization)  
9. Apply decision rules  
10. Display final result  

---

## 8. Implementation  
The project is implemented in Python using the following tools:

- **Pandas** for data handling  
- **Regex (re)** for text processing  
- **Scikit-learn** for Machine Learning  

The algorithm used is **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, which is efficient for text classification tasks. The system is implemented as a command-line application.  

---

## 9. Results  
The system generates the following output:

- Verdict (Safe / Scam)  
- Risk percentage  
- Explanation  
- Detected keywords  
- Number of links  

**Example Output:**
